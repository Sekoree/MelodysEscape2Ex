# MelodysEscape2Ex
(Currently BepInEx based) Melody's Escape 2 Modloader and (Harmony) Patches to add a few more features to the game

### When the game gets updates it usually replaces the unstripped dlls with stripped ones again, so the patch loader will fail, a patch reinstall should usually fix it!
